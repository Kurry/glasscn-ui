# Button

Extends the shadcn/ui button component, with many additional styles for existing and new  
`color`, `radius` and `loading` variants. Example usage:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@itsjavi/glasscn-ui";

<Button color="primary" radius="xl" loading>Submitting...</Button>
```

The following changes have been made, compared to the shadcn/ui component:

- `secondary` *variant* is renamed to `subtle`
- `destructive` variant is now moved to the `danger` *color*
- the `link` variant has now a dotted underline.
- Some padding adjustments to make the buttons similar to Vercel's component library ones.
